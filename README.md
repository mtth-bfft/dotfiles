# dotfiles
Sensible default configuration files, settings and customisations that I use on all the machines I have access to.

## Installing
Simply clone the repository, and run *install.sh* to set everything up.

**Warning**: you need to change your Git contributor name and email address after that.

## Contributing
If you use any of these settings and see something that could be improved or that I could like, feel free to send me an email :)
